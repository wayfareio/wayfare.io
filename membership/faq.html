    <h5>How do I become a member?</h5>
    <p>Become a FLDWRK member by joining one of our workspaces or startup programs. Whether you need a place to work a few days a week, a program to help you pilot your new idea, support to grow your organization into sustainability, or office for you and your team — we’ve got you covered. Start by <a href="/workspaces">finding a workspace</a> or checking out our <a href="/startups">startup programs</a>.</p>

    <h5>Is FLDWRK membership month to month?</h5>
    <p><em>Yep!</em> Our memberships are all month-to-month to allow flexibility and growth based on your unique <a href="/workspaces">coworking</a> or <a href="/startups">startup</a> needs.</p>

    <h5>Do I need to be a member to work at a FLDWRK workspace?</h5>
    <p>No, you do not need to be a member to work out of FLDWRK, but membership allows more flexibility at more affordable rates to work at any of our spaces&#42;.</p>
    <p>*Drop-in rates vary by location. To view yours, visit your <a href="/workspaces">location's</a> rates page.</p>

    <h5>What kind of events do you host for members?</h5>
    <p>In addition to monthly <a href="/membership/learn-from-others/">Forum</a> events, we throw occasional member events like holiday parties, community dinners, and more! We also offer generous discounts to any workshops or conferences that are hosted at FLDWRK locations.</p>
