  <div class="story-text">
    <p><strong>Who are you?</strong></p>

<p>Dylan Budd</p>

<p><strong>What’s the name of your company/organization?</strong></p>

<p>Roots Community Church</p>

<p><strong>The best movie of all time is clearly….</strong></p>

<p>Gladiator…duh :)</p>

<p><strong>What’s your favorite local restaurant?</strong></p>

<p>Il Dolce (Harbor/19th)</p>

<p><strong>How would you spend your ideal day off?</strong></p>

<p>With my family, in our pajamas!</p>

<p><strong>If you could go anywhere in the world you haven’t been, where would you go and why?</strong></p>

<p>That’s a good question. I would love to visit Rome and scour the rich history embedded in that part of Europe.</p>

<p><strong>What do you do for work? Tell us a little bit about how you got to where you are today.</strong></p>

<p>I am a bi-vocational pastor. I have the privilege of pastoring a local church here in Costa Mesa along with two other pastors. I also have the privilege of working part time for a local building material company. I’ve been pastoring for a little over 7 years and working in the construction industry for almost 13.</p>

<p>By God’s grace, He called my wife and I to Orange County for college and decided to keep us here to serve in the local church. It has been one of the greatest joys of our lives.</p>

<p><strong>How do you stay inspired? Productive?</strong></p>

<p>The gospel. If the gospel is true, that is, that God in Christ has paid the highest price in order to redeem sinners (of whom I am chief)- if that is true, then I have an endless well of inspiration and motivation. The love of Christ is incredibly compelling.</p>

<p><strong>What’s your favorite part of your work?</strong></p>

<p>Ministering the gospel through preaching and counseling. I get to show people Jesus in the bible week after week. I can’t think of a greater privilege in life.</p>

<p><strong>What are some of the biggest challenges of your work and what advice would you give to someone experiencing similar challenges?</strong></p>

<p>The greatest challenge is working through the deception of my own heart. The greatest fight in my life is inward. So my advice for minsters of the gospel would be: the gospel you preach is the gospel you desperately need. Love it</p>

<p><strong>Why did you decide to work out of Wayfare?</strong></p>

<p>I needed a space that could accommodate both vocations. Wayfare was a perfect fit and location for me.</p>

<p><strong>What are some ways (if any) we can support you and get involved with your work?</strong></p>

<p>The culture at Wayfare encourages members to partner together for the good of our city. That has already happened in many practical ways!</p>
