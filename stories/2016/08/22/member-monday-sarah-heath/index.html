<h2 class="m-b-2">Member Monday: Sarah Heath</h2>

<p><strong>Who are you?</strong></p>

<p>Sarah Heath</p>

<p><strong>The best movie of all time is clearly….</strong></p>

<p>Newsies and anything Guy Ritchie has made except for that one with Madonna.</p>

<p><strong>What’s your favorite local restaurant?</strong></p>

<p>I have been going to Durty Nelly’s for years. I love that little pub!</p>

<p><strong>How would you spend your ideal day off?</strong></p>

<p>My Ideal day off would probably include one or all of the following: going on a run or to the gym, going on a road trip, taking my dog to the beach, dinner with friends with great food and conversation. Is it the weekend yet?</p>

<p><strong>If you could go anywhere in the world you haven’t been, where would you go and why?</strong></p>

<p>This is probably cheating but Ireland. I am going there in October. My family is from England and as many times as I have been across the pond I have never gone to Ireland. There is something so captivating about photos of Ireland I can’t wait to see the beautiful landscape and visit all the local restaurants and pubs I am traveling with folks who have family there so it is going to be a fun adventure I think! Look out Australia you are next!</p>

<p><strong>What do you do for work? Tell us a little bit about how you got to where you are today.</strong></p>

<p>I am a United Methodist Pastor. In July I was asked to help revitalize and relaunch the community at First UMC in Costa Mesa. I am the lucky person who gets to work at the 100 year old gorgeous church building on 19th!</p>

<p>How I got there is a long story but here is the short version: I came to California after graduating from Grad school in North Carolina where I got my Mdiv at Duke University. It was in grad school that my passion for creating and curating community began. After grad school I was brought out to Irvine to do youth and college ministry. While at that church I was part of a team that created a new worship service and became the lead speaker for that service. I was then asked to go to Rancho Santa Margarita to serve as the preaching pastor of a church who had just merged with another community and I spent 5 years there. It was a wonderful community filled with diversity and creativity and I think really prepared me for the work here in Costa Mesa. It has been amazing to see the community already grow at this little historic church. It is diverse and welcoming and we are just a month into it! I just get to help move it forward and work with developing the site itself to be a place of safety and sanctuary in Costa Mesa. As we say it is “A heart for the city in the heart of the city”.</p>

<p><strong>How do you stay inspired? Productive?</strong></p>

<p>I am inspired by all the amazing friends I have who are bringing goodness to the world. I am also inspired by the people I work with and for. Seeing people go through transformation keeps this job inspiring. Watching lives move closer to who they were intended to be is awe inspiring.</p>

<p>The fact that I always have a looming deadline whether it be a writing deadline, a speaking engagement, or just the fact that Sunday is ALWAYS coming I stay aware that deadlines are a constant! I love the apps Evernote and Asana both of those keep me productive and on task.</p>

<p><strong>What’s your favorite part of your work?</strong></p>

<p>I love getting to be with people in their biggest moments and I love creating things like art, talks, sermons, and studies that connect people to the divine.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2016/08/756ff61dc2bb-Sarah1-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>What are some of the biggest challenges of your work and what advice would you give to someone experiencing similar challenges?</strong></p>

<p>Time management is the hardest part of my job currently. From being a project manager for a big re-build project, to managing volunteers and creating weekly talks my time is filled with good things but I could work 24 hours everyday. I think the best thing I can do is create a team that help me take some of these things off of my desk. I think building a team is always one of the most important things about being a change maker!</p>

<p><strong>Why did you decide to work out of Wayfare?</strong></p>

<p>During the construction of our facility they took down the office space, not only that but someone kept stealing the cooper wire and so we didn’t even have electricity for a month. Just when I thought slow wifi was a stressor having no power caused us to have to get creative! I could have worked from home but being surrounded by change makers was always a goal for us. Working at Wayfare was an intentional choice for me to be in contact with those who were doing some really important and creative things in Costa Mesa that the church community can partner with and enact some crazy goodness in the world!</p>

<p><strong>What are some ways (if any) we can support you and get involved with your work?</strong></p>

<p>We have such a small amazing community I think anytime we can partner with people who are doing things to help change the world we are amplifying the difference we can make in the world. So I think partnerships are one of the greatest ways we can mutually support each other. I also don’t have tons of creative resources so I am always loving to support anyone doing the arts by providing a space for them to do that. And of course you are always welcome to our new/ancient community on Sundays at 10am!</p>
