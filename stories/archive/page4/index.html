        <p class="card-text">When we hear the terms foster care or foster child, there’s a varied amount of emotions that can pop up-compassion, helplessness, sadness, empathy, even anger…there’s something about the picture we have in our mind when we think foster child that evoke this feeling of sadness in us-maybe we imagine torn shoes and dirty hair-because, as humans we recognize that children were never meant to experience things like homelessness, abuse, or neglect. It does something to our gut and, out of a feeling of total loss as to what to do, we turn our eyes and hands towards something a little more… ”manageable.”<br />
<br />
When I think foster care, or foster children, the words that come to my mind are reality, family, and home.<br />
<br />
I became a foster parent in 2012 to my three brothers, ages 2, 7, and 12 when I was 22. I was single, had dreams of going overseas to help people (ironic?) and wasn’t even sure if I wanted to have kids of my own one day. I hadn’t lived with my biological family in over six years, and had been unofficially adopted by an amazing family, so I wasn’t aware how bad the situation had gotten with my bio-mom and three younger half brothers (you can read more of my story from last year’s post with Wayfare here). After two years of taking care of them, two of the three boys were reunified, and after nearly two years of no contact with them, we received a call to come to Orangewood Children’s Center and pick up our two little “lost boys” as we learned to call them. They had been put back in the system.<br />
<br />
Now, we are a family of seven (in those two years, I got married, pregnant, had a baby, adopted a teen and got pregnant again…yep, we’ve been busy).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What I come across most in my conversations about foster care is the lack of want to get involved, not because of a lack of care, but just the fact that it’s, for lack of better words, messy. So, so, messy. The system is messy. Trauma is messy. All of it is really, really messy and, if you’re not empowered and educated, the orphan crisis our country, state, even county is facing, can feel debilitating. How the heck am I supposed to help these kids when it’s too painful to even swallow?<br />
<br />
I want to challenge you, this foster care awareness month, to not focus on the 3,000 kids in Orange County without a home, but to focus on the 1 you can help. In my experience being a foster parent, here are four ways I believe you can make an impact, some big, some small, but all necessary.<br />
<br />
####Become a CASA<br />
<br />
Become a CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) is a volunteer appointed by judges to watch over over and advocate for abused and neglected children, to make sure they don’t get lost in the legal and social services system. CASAs stay with their assigned child until their case is closed, so there is a two year commitment, and not only mentor the youth, but get to represent the foster youth’s wants and needs in court. We love CASA, and have first hand seen it work for one of our adopted kids, but, unfortunately, there is such a large amount of kids in the system, and such a low amount of CASAs, our two other boys are on a waiting list. We need more CASAs (specifically, dudes) to step up! Commitment level: Medium (two year involvement, once a month mentoring, once a month court).<br />
<br />
####Donate to Advokids<br />
Advokids is an amazing non-profit organization founded in 1993 by an attorney and child psychologist working with children entering foster care, who saw a need for better implementation of the system’s resources for the children. They believe (and, hopefully so do  you!) that every foster child in California has the right to safety, security, and a permanent home. They offer free legal aide and counsel for foster parents and foster youth, and really fight for permanency in terms of placement for the children. Sometimes, unfortunately, the kids are the ones who get lost in between all the laws, and legal rights of the birth parents, and are often displaced…Advokids and the lawyers behind it do everything in their power to educate the need for permanent housing for children’s physiological development. They are an organization that has fought for our kids in unique ways. Since they are a non-profit, they run off donations. Consider talking to your employer to match your donation or giving this month for foster care awareness month. Their website is full of information on the foster care system, juvenile court system, and child psychology as pertains to foster children if you’re looking for more general information. Commitment level: zero. Give when/how you want, and educate yourself.<br />
<br />
####Donate Goods or Gift Cards<br />
Like…. good goods. When children are brought into Orangewood Children’s Home, they often come with the clothes on their back. It’s a 24 hour emergency shelter for children that can’t be immediately placed with a family member of foster care placement, and they don’t stay for more than 72 hours. Once children are picked up, they are given a bag of some pants, underwear, and shoes. When we received the call to pick up the boys from Orangewood, they had been there since 3am, and because of all the paperwork, house checks, and fingerprinting we had to go through to pick up our boys, we didn’t get to take them home until 8pm. When we went through the bag of clothes the boys had received, nothing was new… even the underwear was used. Thankfully, we have a strong community that was ready to help at the drop of a hat, so we were able to kindly reject the items. But my heart breaks for the children and emergency placements that don’t have access to this kind of quick help. Remember this when going through your old clothes and donation pile: these kids are precious, and deserve the best you can give. Would you let your son or daughter wear someone’s used underwear, even if it was washed? Would you let your son or daughter wear stained or ripped shirts to school? These kids aren’t ungrateful, they will take whatever you give, but they are still kids, and more than that, humans who deserve the dignity of clean clothes. Here’s a wishlist by Orangewood Children’s Home for reference. If you know a foster parent, consider giving them a gift card to Marshall’s, TJ Maxx, or Ross (places where you can get name brand clothes at a decent bargain) or Target because…Target is everything, people.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
####ASK, and expect nothing in return <br />
If you know a foster parent, foster youth, or former foster youth, don’t assume you know what they need. Ask. Ask questions like, “What would be helpful?” “What do the kids like to do?” We had a friend pay for our youngest guy to play soccer-his first time ever playing team sports. It was an amazing experience for not just him to get connected to a team, but for us to bond as his primary support and family. This time around, I’ve learned to let people give and not give into the pressure to give back in return, but the first time around, some donors put this unspoken pressure that they would receive something from us in return…It wasn’t fair and it put a ton of pressure on not just me, but on the kids to be at different dinners throughout the week to thank people. Give without the expectation of receiving anything in return, not even a thank you. Foster parents are busy and these kids are precious with unique circumstances. It’s your job to respect that.<br />
<br />
The foster care system can seem overwhelming, and it’s tempting to look away out of helplessness. Many people tell me that they can never be a foster parent…but you don’t have to be a foster parent to help a foster child! There are big and small ways to make an impact on a child’s life. These are our kids, Orange County. We hold a unique responsibility to embrace them and empower the foster parents who have stepped in around them to give them the best childhood possible, considering the circumstances.</p>

I am in the very beginning stages of planning a trip to Peru next Summer, which will fulfill a lifelong dream! I’ve always wanted to hike Machu Picchu, and I’ve heard that barely breaks the top 10 list of things to do in Peru, so I’m stoked.<br />
<br />
What do you do for work? Tell us a little bit about how you got to where you are today.<br />
<br />
I’m working as the Marketing Coordinator for Coach.me, which in all honesty fell into my lap. My brother is the founder, and Coach.me is the product of many years of him dreaming it up. I started doing work for him as a side project, but ended up really loving it. I’m only a year out of school, and still working on nailing down exactly what I want to do, so it’s awesome to get to work with my brother and help him achieve his dreams while I figure out how to chase after my own.<br />
<br />
How do you stay inspired? Productive?<br />
<br />
Coach.me is a platform that connects people with one-on-one coaching for a plethora of goals, and one of the main habits that’s coached is Productivity. Because of this, I’ve tried a lot of different tricks, and there are three things that have proven very effective in keeping me on track and productive: Writing a to-do list each morning with one main goal for the day, only checking my email during pre-set times that stay the same every day, and meditating briefly each morning. I’m not to the point where I can meditate for long periods of time, but spending 5 minutes each morning clearing my mind lets me approach each day in a fresh way.<br />
<br />
What’s your favorite part of your work?<br />
<br />
My favorite thing about work is getting to learn from everyone on the team. Getting to understand the behind the scenes of projects, even ones I don’t have any part in, is an incredible learning opportunity.<br />
<br />
What are some of the biggest challenges of your work and what advice would you give to someone experiencing similar challenges?<br />
<br />
One of the biggest challenges is working in a company that’s dispersed, because communication can be hard when there’s no face-to-face interaction. My advice is to never underestimate the power of chit-chat. We have a check-in round each morning where we talk about things that are non work-related, which makes communication about work-related issues throughout the day much easier. It opens those channels right from the get go.<br />
<br />
Why did you decide to work out of Wayfare?<br />
<br />
I really like getting up in the morning with somewhere to go. It gives my day a lot more intention than just walking from my bedroom to my kitchen table and sitting down to work. What I realized after I started working here was that I also really missed having a sense of community. There’s something about surrounding yourself with likeminded people all working towards something that can’t be reproduced.<br />
<br />
What are some ways (if any) we can support you and get involved with your work?<br />
<br />
I’ve had a dream for a long time of starting a non-profit that provides scholarships for kids to get involved in sports. I’m planning to start working on this as a side project this summer, but I have no idea what I’m doing, so any advice about where to start or how to get the ball rolling would be greatly appreciated!<br />

        <p class="card-text">1. Bring Something New<br />
<br />
When you are traveling, it is always a good idea to bring something new. This is for kids and adults alike. For kids, a new book or a new set of stickers will do wonders in curing boredom. I’m being honest, bringing a new book or even a new item of clothing helps me feel excited about the trip I’m taking.  As we embark on a new year, this might mean developing a new habit or practice, visiting a new location, trying a new hobby, or starting a new business. This could mean changing where you work or how you work by joining a new workspace and being a part of a new community of people. Perhaps a local awesome coworking community. See what I did there? Wayfare loves new members!</p>

        <p class="card-text">If you are breathing a sigh of post-holiday relief, you are not alone. Before the shock and grinch-shaming ensue, know that I am just as much of a sucker for Christmas as the rest of us. There are very few things in this world I love more than sitting around the dinner table with family, taking a break to enjoy those I love, making pretty gift wrappings, and my cupboards filled with all things peppermint-flavored. However, with the beauty of community and Christmas cheer also comes a madness of unabated consumerism and pressure. Whether it’s the stresses of buying impressive and thoughtful gifts, filling our time with the right loved ones, or rushing around to beat traffic, visit Aunt Sally, and time the holiday sales right; there is something relieving about the post-holiday silence.</p>

        <h3 class="card-title"><a href="/stories/2015/12/16/tafi/">Taffy on Planes and Origami on Trains</a></h3>
        <p class="card-text">I was recently on a plane with my three kids. We were flying to meet up with my husband, so I was outnumbered. The way the plane was set up, I sat in a row with my youngest, and my two oldest sat next to each other in the same row across the aisle from me. The plane had a particularly intense take-off and from across the aisle I heard a nervous voice call out, “Mom, can I come sit by you?”<br />
<br />
I looked over to see my oldest had become a bit nervous with the intensity of the take-off. As I reached across the aisle to take his hand I said, “Not right now buddy. You need to stay in your seat. But I’m here. You are safe. Nothing is wrong.”<br />
<br />
That is when I heard from the seat behind me, “Oh, yeah, he was so nervous, I saw him, he was just freaking out.”<br />
<br />
I responded, “He’ll be okay.”  And to him I kept repeating, “I got you buddy, you are safe.”<br />
<br />
“I’ve got taffy. Does he want taffy?  I got it from Disneyland,” the stranger offered.<br />
<br />
“Oh, no thank you, he has snacks in his bag if he’s hungry,” I replied.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure? You didn’t see him, but I saw him.”<br />
<br />
Then she reached out to him and said, “It’s okay. I’m here for you.”<br />
<br />
At this point I was becoming irritated. Also, I could tell my son’s nervousness was only increasing as a random stranger was attempting to engage him in conversation, offer him taffy, and pat his shoulder. Just as I was searching for the words to tell her to stop, the captain turned off the seat-belt sign. We all know what that means:  It is obviously an invitation to immediately leap out of one’s seat, give the taffy wielding stranger a nervous look, and hop across the aisle into your mother’s lap. Once my son made it out of Taffy Lady’s glance, no more interaction was had for the rest of the flight.<br />
<br />
Once the plane landed, she hopped out of her seat, glanced to our row and with a gasp said, “OH! You have THREE of them! (referring to my children) And you are all ALONE!!!”<br />
<br />
“Yep!”, I replied. Then I smiled big and she then turned and walked up the aisle and off the plane.<br />
<br />
The next part of our journey involved a ride on a commuter train. So, we got our luggage and slowly made it to the train with only a couple of mild tantrums from the littlest usually centered around if someone other than her pushed an elevator button. Once we got on the train we found a place to sit and settled in for the hour long ride.<br />
<br />
While we were riding, many people got on and off the train. Eventually a man boarded with his bike and sat down nearby. He kept to himself mostly, and played a cute game of smiles with my youngest. We were riding during rush hour, so it was fairly crowded most of the ride. When we started to reach the end of the line, and the crowd started to thin, the kids were starting to get restless and could be heard repeatedly asking, “How many more stops? When will we get there?”<br />
<br />
It was at that point that the friendly fellow sitting near us held up a small piece of paper and asked me if it was okay if he gave my kids a “helicopter”. It was a strip of paper that he had fashioned into a simple toy, that when held above one’s head would begin fluttering to the ground and spinning like a helicopter. THEY WERE DELIGHTED. We engaged in conversation and he ended up showing my kids how to make these little paper creations. I was so thankful for his desire to interact with my kids during the last part of what was a long day.<br />
<br />
After we got off of the train and met my husband at the station, we got in the car and I began telling him of our fellow travelers. As I thought about it a little more over the next day, I wondered to myself why one person’s interaction and attempt at help rubbed me the wrong way and why another person’s was welcomed.<br />
<br />
I think there are a few reasons for the stark contrast between my reactions to the help from Taffy Lady and Origami Man. Taffy Lady was abrupt and forceful in her approach, assumed she knew better than me, did not ask permission, her offer had very little practical application to what my son needed in that moment and I got the feeling her “helping” had more to do with her than helping us. In contrast, Origami Man had built a rapport with my kids, asked permission to interact, offered exactly what my kids were craving (a distraction from boredom), was unassuming and humble, and was gentle and friendly in his approach.<br />
<br />
We can learn a lot from Taffy Lady and Origami Man. It is easy to villainize those who irritate us, but I wonder how many times we don’t understand a situation enough to intervene as we try to make the world a better place. Do I know enough to offer specific solutions? Could my efforts have adverse effects?</p>

        <h3 class="card-title"><a href="/stories/2015/12/14/coffe-and-sleep/">Coffe and Sleep</a></h3>
        <p class="card-text">The greatest thing about working for Wayfare is that we get to help people help others. The not so great part is that when we want to sleep, our brains still want to work. It’s obvious, but without sleep none of those incredible projects are going to get done.<br />
<br />
So why aren’t we sleeping? The exciting projects, of course. And coffee. You smiled a little when you read that word, huh? Then you were angry that I implied a correlation between that sweet cup of happiness and your run in with insomnia. Just hang tight a bit before you throw your laptop at me.<br />
<br />
Coffee may be the only thing keeping you from turning into the Incredible Hulk in the morning, but before you overdo it on your cup of Bruce Banner, take a second to monitor how much you’ve had. Sure we’ll admit what happens when we haven’t had coffee, but we don’t often talk about what happens when we’ve had too much. Personally, I  go from productive to a jittery mess, knocking things over and typing emails with caps lock on. But let’s not get crazy; I’m not saying no to coffee. In fact, I’m praising it and also suggesting a tool to help you enjoy it more—the UP Coffee app from Jawbone.<br />
<br />
Let me break it down. Too much coffee = no sleep. Not enough coffee = sleep—but at inappropriate times like on your keyboard or your breakfast burrito. UP Coffee helps us find balance between what it calls “sleep ready” and “wired.”<br />
<br />
By tracking how much coffee we put in our caffeine riddled bodies, Up Coffee can tell us when to stop consuming. The result is a much more relaxed evening and a great night’s sleep. Find it in the app store, and while you’re at it, check out Jawbone’s other great health technology.</p>

        <p class="card-text">I was driving in my daily traffic jam hell listening to NPR and yelling at slow drivers (we live in SoCal, give me a break). Robert Segal was about to bring it home when my phone rang. Was it work, or work related, or work adjacent? I really don’t know but apparently it was extremely pressing and required all of my attention; I answered, hands free at this point. I ended the call and began thumbing through my phone while crawling on the 5. I had to check on something, and I needed to do it right then. I looked down, opened my mail app and glanced up to find the car in front of me had completely stopped. I just about shoved my foot through the floor of my weathered Ford Focus, sending the car to a screeching stop. I didn’t hit the guy, but almost. With my adrenaline through the roof and the guy in front of me flashing some very colorful sign language, I found myself considering, why?</p>

        <p class="card-text">I used to carry business cards—lots of them. I’d exchange them with people at conferences and during meeting introductions. Instead of actually communicating with each other again, though, I regret to say a lot of business card passing was just an outdated exercise in corporate traditionalism.<br />
<br />
“I might as well have just handed you a quarter, but instead, here’s a reminder of my name and inflated title.” Anything important or actionable was directly entered into our phones.<br />
<br />
Ok, maybe I’m being too harsh on myself and those people who I never heard from again. Maybe not.<br />
<br />
Then this morning as one of our startup incubator participants asked, “So I should get business cards, right?” (Natural question. It’s just what you do). I found myself saying, “No, what you need is a call to action card.” It flowed as if I consciously knew what I was saying.<br />
<br />
Then I realized we recently made a call to action card (without thinking to call it that) for prospective Wayfare coworking members. We created this small square card with the following call to action:<br />
<br />
“Come visit Wayfare for an introductory day of pure, coworking greatness.”<br />
<br />
With a short description to reinforce a core brand statement, which includes references to coffee and fixing the broken world, we included our location, email address, and phone number, along with a unique, one-time use code on each card.<br />
<br />
Now, when I meet someone who fits our coworking demographic (independent creative, entrepreneur, or early stage organization), instead of giving them a me-centered business card, I hand them one of these cards that’s focused on their needs.<br />
<br />
I tell them we’d love to have them check out our space, and then I record their name on a spreadsheet that corresponds with their unique card code so we can measure the effectiveness of our efforts.<br />
<br />
Some other effective examples of call to action cards I’ve seen:<br />
<br />
“Bring in this card to enjoy a cup of coffee on us.”<br />
<br />
“Use this promo code for 20% of your next order before Christmas.”<br />
<br />
“Post a photo of this card on Instagram to receive a free one-month subscription.”<br />
<br />
It could even be as simple as “Join the conversation at blog.wayfare.io” or “Follow us on Instagram and Twitter @wayfarehq.”<br />
<br />
The key question to ask is: What call to action can I use that meets a real need for my target audience? Jump over to Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter to share your ideas.<br />
<br />
Oh, and one last call to action. I’m holding the card with one-time code WF76811 in my back pocket. The first reader to contact us with the code receives one free introductory day of pure, coworking greatness here at Wayfare HQ.<br />
<br />
Who’s in?</p>
