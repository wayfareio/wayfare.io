        <p class="card-text">At Wayfare we believe that relationships are a catalyst for the world’s best future. We believe that everyone has something to offer, and that mentorship can be a fantastic way for everyday people to make a significant impact in the life of another.  Mentorship is, at its core, intentionally engaging in relationship with another person and genuinely caring for them while providing the guidance they need to grow. This is the first in a series of posts that will outline various types of mentorship and programs facilitating it.</p>

        <p class="card-text">May is Foster Care Awareness Month, and we couldn’t think of a better way to wrap up the month than with a guest blog by our dear friend Sally Kim. Sally is an Orange County local, affectionately titled a “Mister” by her brothers, a newlywed, and a mother to her honeymoon baby girl, Scout. She’s passionate about foster care and spends her free time representing foster families in the Huntington Beach High School District, and content managing for The Yellow Conference. She is also a wonderful story teller, and we are thrilled and honored to have her share her story with you all on our blog today.</p>

        <p class="card-text">I was driving in my daily traffic jam hell listening to NPR and yelling at slow drivers (we live in SoCal, give me a break). Robert Segal was about to bring it home when my phone rang. Was it work, or work related, or work adjacent? I really don’t know but apparently it was extremely pressing and required all of my attention; I answered, hands free at this point. I ended the call and began thumbing through my phone while crawling on the 5. I had to check on something, and I needed to do it right then. I looked down, opened my mail app and glanced up to find the car in front of me had completely stopped. I just about shoved my foot through the floor of my weathered Ford Focus, sending the car to a screeching stop. I didn’t hit the guy, but almost. With my adrenaline through the roof and the guy in front of me flashing some very colorful sign language, I found myself considering, why?</p>

        <p class="card-text">I used to carry business cards—lots of them. I’d exchange them with people at conferences and during meeting introductions. Instead of actually communicating with each other again, though, I regret to say a lot of business card passing was just an outdated exercise in corporate traditionalism.<br />

“I might as well have just handed you a quarter, but instead, here’s a reminder of my name and inflated title.” Anything important or actionable was directly entered into our phones.<br />
<br />
Ok, maybe I’m being too harsh on myself and those people who I never heard from again. Maybe not.<br />
<br />
Then this morning as one of our startup incubator participants asked, “So I should get business cards, right?” (Natural question. It’s just what you do). I found myself saying, “No, what you need is a call to action card.” It flowed as if I consciously knew what I was saying.<br />
<br />
Then I realized we recently made a call to action card (without thinking to call it that) for prospective Wayfare coworking members. We created this small square card with the following call to action:<br />
<br />
“Come visit Wayfare for an introductory day of pure, coworking greatness.”<br />
<br />
With a short description to reinforce a core brand statement, which includes references to coffee and fixing the broken world, we included our location, email address, and phone number, along with a unique, one-time use code on each card.<br />
<br />
Now, when I meet someone who fits our coworking demographic (independent creative, entrepreneur, or early stage organization), instead of giving them a me-centered business card, I hand them one of these cards that’s focused on their needs.<br />
<br />
I tell them we’d love to have them check out our space, and then I record their name on a spreadsheet that corresponds with their unique card code so we can measure the effectiveness of our efforts.<br />
<br />
Some other effective examples of call to action cards I’ve seen:<br />
<br />
“Bring in this card to enjoy a cup of coffee on us.”<br />
<br />
“Use this promo code for 20% of your next order before Christmas.”<br />
<br />
“Post a photo of this card on Instagram to receive a free one-month subscription.”<br />
<br />
It could even be as simple as “Join the conversation at blog.wayfare.io” or “Follow us on Instagram and Twitter @wayfarehq.”<br />
<br />
The key question to ask is: What call to action can I use that meets a real need for my target audience? Jump over to Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter to share your ideas.<br />
<br />
Oh, and one last call to action. I’m holding the card with one-time code WF76811 in my back pocket. The first reader to contact us with the code receives one free introductory day of pure, coworking greatness here at Wayfare HQ.<br />
<br />

        <p class="card-text">In planning for Q Commons I get asked this question a lot. So, I figured I would write a blog post about Q, my experience, and Q Commons. Visit the Q Commons Costa Mesa site for information on the next Q Commons gathering at Wayfare HQ.<br />
<br />
This video of Gabe Lyons, the founder of Q Ideas, explains what Q is about. If you can’t watch the video, or even if you can, please visit http://qideas.org/about/ to read more about it. In it he says that he founded Q because he wanted to create a place where people, especially Christian leaders in what he defines as the 7 sectors of society, can ask big questions about faith and culture and think for themselves about what the answers ought to be. In doing so, conversations start, and this brings about the best thinking possible on a number of different issues. The talks given at Q address the topics of our day and then compel people to consider a response where we can work together to advance good in our communities. In addition to the Q national gathering, there are online resources and community conversations, as well as a twice yearly local gathering called Q Commons which is hosted by Q partners around the globe.<br />
<br />
MY Q EXPERIENCE<br />
<br />
I first heard about Q in 2011 years ago after my brother attended a Q national gathering. My first question was “What is Q?” He told me that Q is for questions and Q Ideas is an organization that encourages people to ask questions and think well to advance the common good. While I thought it sounded cool, you have to understand, Jeff is a very philosophical and deep thinker, so I thought it was right up his alley. I was glad he had a good time and that was the extent of my thoughts about it.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to the next year, when my brother invited my husband (similarly cerebral) to go with him to the Q national gathering in LA. While I spoke to him on the phone during his time at Q, he kept saying “This is awesome. You are coming next year.” I spent the entire next year hearing from him about talks given at Q. Then, a year after my husband went, I found myself, in Nashville, TN with my brother, my sister-in-law, and my husband.<br />
<br />
When I returned from Nashville, I could not stop referring to what I heard, and almost a year later I still bring up the things I heard and the impact my experience had on me in weekly conversations. It was impactful, fun, inspiring, challenging, and all around fantastic!<br />
<br />
As with most things in life, hearing about them is informative, but experiencing them can be transformative. That is why I am beyond thrilled that Q introduced a gathering called Q Commons.<br />
<br />
WHAT IS Q COMMONS?<br />
<br />
After several years of having a national gathering, the people at Q recognized that attending the yearly national gathering was not always feasible for people around the globe to attend. So they came up with an idea for a local gathering called Q Commons. The goal of Q Commons is to allow people around the world to gather locally in their cities and experience Q without having to travel or take time off work. Q Commons enables people to gather with other leaders in their city and listen to 3 talks via video, which all Q Commons attendees across the globe view, as well as 3 local in person talks that are geared more toward the questions that people in that local community may ask or have a particular interest in. It also serves to connect leaders of various occupations and spheres of influence in the same city to form a community of local like-minded people who can keep the conversation going throughout the year. If you are intrigued at all, I highly recommend that you come to Q Commons and experience it for yourself. Join me and others in Orange County at Wayfare HQ in Costa Mesa as we stay curious, think well, and advance good so that we can do our part in pursuing the world’s best future together.</p>
