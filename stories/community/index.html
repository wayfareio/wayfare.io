      <p class="card-text">My dad is a man whose hands were perpetually rough with calluses and deep cracks, whose fingernails were cut dangerously short,left with barely enough room to be lined with dirt. He spent his evenings after work and his weekend mornings in our garden, wrist deep in the familiar warmth of soil that was nourished by our friendly hens and the roots of our thriving plot of vegetables. I inherited my dad’s deep love for the earth and some small part of his green thumb, which instinctively drove me to write my senior thesis on the dynamics of sustainable agriculture in Orange County. From that research arose one of my lifetime heroes: Dan Barber, co-owner of Blue Hill Farm and a leader in the world of food culture and sustainability.<br />
<br />
In his riveting ethnography titled ‘The Third Plate: Field Notes on the Future of Food’, Barber comments boldly on the current state of our agricultural system. “In the rush to industrialize farming, we’ve lost the understanding, implicit since the beginning of agriculture, that food is a process, a web of relationships, not an individual ingredient or commodity.”<br />
<br />
Before the wave of monocultures that struck our nation in the early 1900s, agriculture was characterized by small farms that were home to a community of livestock and a diverse range of crops grown on the same plot. Each plant was dependent on the other to thrive. An ancient Native American technique called companion gardening is the purest example of this symbiotic relationship that exists between plants. Certain plants complement each other especially well, such as beans, squash, and corn. Each were planted in close proximity to one another to support each other in each stage of growth. Beans fix nitrogen in their roots, improving the fertility of the plot. Shallow squash roots act as living mulch, and their spiky leaves ward off pests. Corn acts as a natural pole for the beans to climb, and in turn the beans stabilize the corn stalk. Their relationship is not ambiguous, but rather a symbiotic partnership where there needs to be equal levels of dependence between each plant, intentionality on behalf of the gardener, and creativity in designing the plot.<br />
<br />
From the idea of companion gardening, we introduce to you: Forum, by Wayfare. Forum is built on the idea that we are all believers in the beauty of work and the necessity of learning. As we strive to advance the common good, our weakness is self-dependency. Without inspiration, support, and opportunities to challenge our thinking, we wither. We are not to be a wash of industry-specific monocultures, bound by the limitations of self-sufficiency.<br />
<br />
Forum is a free for Global members! Bring your own lunch and be a part of a culture of people who crave opportunities to challenge each other and build a community around a shared interest in the common good. Join us at Wayfare HQ in Costa Mesa as we launch our first Forum from 12-1pm on Monday, October 3rd. Not local? Participate on your own time via podcast or join us in new locations as we continue to expand.<br />
<br />
October’s topics + speakers are listed below, so you can save the date. Also - great news! Our first Forum is open to EVERYONE - not just Wayfare members! So bring a friend and learn together over lunch.<br />
<br />
October 3 Joel Beukelman, “Do Something: The Power of Personal Branding”<br />
<br />
October 10 Jeff Tanner, “Redeeming Work: Exploring the Future of Work as a Tool for Creating the World’s Best Future”<br />
<br />
October 17 Jonathan Menkes + Thomas Yee, “10 IP Pitfalls Every Startup Should Avoid”<br />
<br />
October 24 Steven + Amber Cowell, “Dropping’ Mics on Open Adoption”<br />
<br />
October 31 Emily McLaughlin, “How to Improve Your Company Culture Without Spending a Dime”</p>

      <p class="card-text">I am currently developing the business model for The Integrated which essentially supports emerging adults, age 18-26, transition into adulthood. I am writing the curriculum and developing the website as well as doing everything, except social media (because I have an awesome intern team and intern director!). The Integrated started about 2 years ago when I decided I wanted to mentor a few college students because it is such a vital and crucial developmental time for them. Gandolf, aka Jeff Tanner (co-founder of Wayfare), planted the seed that my ideas could turn into a non-profit… so here I am today.</p>

      <p class="card-text">Day to day, you can mostly find me slinging lattes, running errands, creating new syrup flavors and catching up with my regulars but I am slowly making more time for myself to work on my business instead of at my business. If I had known how much hard work being a business owner would take, I probably would have never taken the leap but I can’t imagine doing anything else. After falling in love with coffee on a farm in Uganda and working at 3 local coffee shops here in Costa Mesa, I decided to go for it on my own. I am currently the owner, manager, accountant, social media coordinator, and one of two baristas for Neat Coffee but I am working hard toward eventually having a full team, a better work/life balance and a larger shop that serves excellent coffee and provides a healthy space for the community.</p>

      <p class="card-text">Nuru’s mission is to end extreme poverty in remote, rural areas. Right now we have community development projects in Kenya, Ethiopia, and we’re expanding to a third country next year. I am constantly inspired by my brilliant colleagues, our incredible local teams and farmers, and everyone’s tireless efforts in achieving Nuru’s mission. With a mission like this it isn’t difficult to stay productive. Practically though with two kids at home, I have to utilize every minute of kid-free work-time to its fullest (well besides the important time I spend exploring the amazing Skype Mojis to ensure I start off my Skype meetings in style).</p>

      <p class="card-text">Who are you?<br />
<br />
Kati Stubblebine<br />
<br />
What’s the name of your company/organization?<br />
Coach.me<br />
<br />
The best movie of all time is clearly….<br />
<br />
A League of Their Own<br />
<br />
What’s your favorite local restaurant?<br />
<br />
Sessions West Coast Deli<br />
<br />
How would you spend your ideal day off?<br />
<br />
Any day is a good day if I’m surrounded by good people and good dogs. The best days also incorporate great coffee, a hike, and some sort of sporting event (preferably baseball or basketball).<br />
<br />
If you could go anywhere in the world you haven’t been, where would you go and why?<br />
<br />
I am in the very beginning stages of planning a trip to Peru next Summer, which will fulfill a lifelong dream! I’ve always wanted to hike Machu Picchu, and I’ve heard that barely breaks the top 10 list of things to do in Peru, so I’m stoked.<br />
<br />
What do you do for work? Tell us a little bit about how you got to where you are today.<br />
<br />
I’m working as the Marketing Coordinator for Coach.me, which in all honesty fell into my lap. My brother is the founder, and Coach.me is the product of many years of him dreaming it up. I started doing work for him as a side project, but ended up really loving it. I’m only a year out of school, and still working on nailing down exactly what I want to do, so it’s awesome to get to work with my brother and help him achieve his dreams while I figure out how to chase after my own.<br />
<br />
How do you stay inspired? Productive?<br />
<br />
Coach.me is a platform that connects people with one-on-one coaching for a plethora of goals, and one of the main habits that’s coached is Productivity. Because of this, I’ve tried a lot of different tricks, and there are three things that have proven very effective in keeping me on track and productive: Writing a to-do list each morning with one main goal for the day, only checking my email during pre-set times that stay the same every day, and meditating briefly each morning. I’m not to the point where I can meditate for long periods of time, but spending 5 minutes each morning clearing my mind lets me approach each day in a fresh way.<br />
<br />
What’s your favorite part of your work?<br />
<br />
My favorite thing about work is getting to learn from everyone on the team. Getting to understand the behind the scenes of projects, even ones I don’t have any part in, is an incredible learning opportunity.<br />
<br />
What are some of the biggest challenges of your work and what advice would you give to someone experiencing similar challenges?<br />
<br />
One of the biggest challenges is working in a company that’s dispersed, because communication can be hard when there’s no face-to-face interaction. My advice is to never underestimate the power of chit-chat. We have a check-in round each morning where we talk about things that are non work-related, which makes communication about work-related issues throughout the day much easier. It opens those channels right from the get go.<br />
<br />
Why did you decide to work out of Wayfare?<br />
<br />
I really like getting up in the morning with somewhere to go. It gives my day a lot more intention than just walking from my bedroom to my kitchen table and sitting down to work. What I realized after I started working here was that I also really missed having a sense of community. There’s something about surrounding yourself with likeminded people all working towards something that can’t be reproduced.<br />
<br />
What are some ways (if any) we can support you and get involved with your work?<br />
<br />
I’ve had a dream for a long time of starting a non-profit that provides scholarships for kids to get involved in sports. I’m planning to start working on this as a side project this summer, but I have no idea what I’m doing, so any advice about where to start or how to get the ball rolling would be greatly appreciated!<br />
