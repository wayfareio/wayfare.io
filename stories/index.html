        <p class="card-text">Simplicity, Sabbath, Kon Mari, Minimalism, Balance…being in the creative industry, primarily in the blogging world, I hear these words a lot. Oh, you too? I’m not surprised. From the Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up to [Capsule Wardrobes], to Documentaries…there seems to be an incessant hunt for slowness. Here’s the thing, simplicity and rest are not trends; they are absolute necessities for our survival. <br />
<br />
There are many, many opinions and how-to’s on creating space to rest. You can go through all your clothes and throw away whatever doesn’t spark joy (the Kon Mari Method) and download the latest productivity apps (I’m totally into MinimaLIST right now), but unless we get to the root of our busyness and constant waves of rush, we will never fully enter into rest.<br />
<br />
My husband is a worship pastor, we have two children under two, and three in school. I work freelance as a writer, teaching workshops and coaching for blogs and non-profits. His job can take him anywhere from one to ten nights a month, and leaves me alone on the weekends, and mine takes consistent creative juice-flow while wiping high chairs and scrubbing cherrios off the floor (ok, you can’t actually scrub cherrios, but you get the concept, right?)…and, in between all of this, we are called to rest. Yes. Called to rest. Let’s eliminate the buzzword balance and replace it with dance. It is absolutely necessary for us to find the dance, the harmony, between work, and rest, because, if we do not learn to rest well, we cannot impact the world with our work.<br />
<br />
Instead of telling you a list of things you must do, eliminate, or check to create a rhythm of rest in your life, here are some tools I’ve learned as I journey through our chaotic, creative, and beautiful life:<br />
<br />
<br />
  <br />
    Stop putting pressure on yourself to rest. This totally debunks the purpose of it. We get so tangled in knots about making sure we’re resting that we are stressed about getting rest (huh?). Instead, lay out what your ideal routine looks like, then lay out what your survival routine looks like. You will experience both in your life, and it can be a consistent, and, dare I say, beautiful ebb and flow between the two as you navigate through life. Everyday will not be ideal. In fact, most days will not be ideal. Most days, especially those with little people in their care, will be sheer chaos. It’s how we journey through those days that count.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
    Light a Candle. I am, however, a huge fan of the Sabbath, and believe it’s something we’re called to do. I believe Sabbath and day offs are two different beasts to tackle; that one is for oil changes and raking leaves, and the other is for pausing and letting life happen around you, while you completely let go of your daily agenda, responsibilities, and worries to worship. How we do this is, come Sunday afternoon, after the busiest time of week for us (remember, pastor family), we light a candle to initiate the end of busy and the beginning of Sabbath. I make the same meal in the crockpot every single Sunday, I clean the house deeply so that come Sunday night and Monday morning I can breathe and be present with my family without noticing the crumbs on the floor, I delete social media from my phone and have our kids turn off their devices and put them in a drawer. We shut down, gathering around the table with a candle resting in the middle, and play the question game, then gather in the living room for board games or reading, or just being quiet, but present, together.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
    Create quiet hours. One thing we love to do, and don’t do nearly enough, are quiet hours. I have carried this false belief for years that I must be able to do anything, everything, always. No matter how crazy the kids are, or how insane my husband’s ministry is, or how close my work deadlines are, I thought I needed to roll with it to show how strong I am. The reality is, rest reveals strength. I had to come to terms with the fact that I need set, sacred spaces of total silence, or I will lose my (insert appropriate emoji here). We decided to implement quiet hours with our kids after realizing (one) we hate screens and (two) kids hate life without screens. We believe in the power of boredom, and that creativity can spring from giving ourselves, and our loved ones, spaces without forced stimulation. So, in our ideal schedule, we have an hour a day of no screens and of total quiet. Sometimes we’ll have some easy music on, and this usually takes place during the toddler’s naptime. Each person is responsible for finding their own silent activity, whether it’s making paper airplanes, reading a book, scrolling through a blog (for me! It’s a rule bend because it’s an important way I experience rest), making a slow, pour over coffee. This is not family play time, this is not time to engage, but rather to step back so we can come together and be fully, fully present with each other when we do choose to reconnect. Our kids have come to love it so much that if we don’t have it for a few days, they actually start to ask for it.<br />
  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  It is absolutely necessary for us to find the dance, the harmony, between work, and rest, because, if we do not learn to rest well, we cannot impact the world with our work.<br />
<br />
<br />
The truth is, there is no simple formula or perfect way to create rhythms of rest in our lives. There are tools and opinions that can be helpful, but don’t bombard yourself with research in a hunt for the perfect experience. The secret, my secret, is to accept the season of life you are in at the present, and embrace what the dance between work and rest looks like for you today. Recognize your ideal rhythm, and implement a variation of that into your current season. By implementing sacred space to rest, your work will be more impactful and life-giving for not only yourself, but the world you are serving.</p>

        <p class="card-text">According to the Strengths Finder 2.0 (of which I am a huge fan), my top strength is Achiever. So when a day goes by where I haven’t achieved all of the things that I set out to do in a day, I have a hard time feeling like I have accomplished anything at all. This tends to be a problem for me because as the cofounder of a small, but growing organization, I know what it is like to have an entire day go by and to be left wondering where all of my time went! At the end of the day, even if I’ve been productive and I’ve clearly made progress in several small areas, if I spent very little time executing on my primary objectives it can feel defeating.</p>

        <p class="card-text">There’s a not so subtle voice that wells up inside of me more often than I’d like to admit. It’s the ugly voice of comparison. This voice leads to one of two problematic feelings for me: inferiority or superiority. Because the truth about comparison is that it goes both ways. It’s the voice that says what I do doesn’t matter, because someone else is doing something better. It is the voice that minimizes what others do because I don’t see the value in it or understand it. It’s the voice that tells me I don’t have anything to offer because I don’t have everything together. It’s the voice that also says I don’t need to feel too bad about my shortcomings, because at least I’m not quite as much of a mess as so-and-so. But today I’d like to boldly declare, regardless of what it says, the voice of comparison is a liar.</p>

        <p class="card-text">One of my favorite movies is Disney’s “The Kid”. In the scene where big Russ is trying to explain his job as an image consultant and little Rusty is trying to understand what that means, he looks up and in a childish, drawn out tone says, “But what do I doooo?”<br />
<br />
This very phrase and in Rusty’s tone went through my head about 1,000 times as we started exploring re-articulating our mission statement. I was newly hired as the Executive Director of Mika Community Development Corporation but had been a part of the organization for 11 of our 12 years. Our work wasn’t changing but we needed to clarify and focus the most core part of our work, our mission.</p>

        <p class="card-text">You started something! That’s a big deal. Whether you’ve been at it for awhile or you are just starting out, you might find yourself exploring the idea of moving to your own office space. Next step…secure a lease, right? Maybe not.<br />
<br />
We’ve asked a few of the members that work out Wayfare full time why they have chosen to have their offices and build their team inside of the a shared workspace environment rather than in their own private office space. A few main themes came up: The Community, The Flexibility, and Business Opportunities.</p>

        <p class="card-text">I’ve heard it said that if there is a choice to be right or be kind, choose kindness. I love this sentiment and often encourage my kids (and myself for that matter) to think in this way. But in reality, don’t both matter? Truth without kindness tends to fall on deaf ears, and kindness without truth really isn’t kind, its flattery. True kindness comes from a desire for the best possible outcome for everyone involved. This usually entails working together. Not just tolerating someone who is occupying space in close proximity to you, but actually doing work in cooperation with one another.<br />
<br />
From people on your team at work, to people you rub shoulders with in a shared workspace (yay coworking!), to working with and advocating on behalf of others, working together is important. As we identify needs and consider how to help, it often means working with people who are different than us. This could mean working with the person or people responsible for the problem you are trying to solve. It could mean joining someone very different than you who feels called to the same work. It could mean working to keep relationships in tact even when we disagree on a lot. We all encounter moments when differences come to the surface and we need to work together to make progress.<br />
<br />
If working together is important, how do we accomplish the important work? These two phrases may help.</p>

<br />
If you’re anything like me, you talk about practicing your Spanish more than you actually find time to do it. For many people, it’s been since high school, which, is getting further and further away. Our lives are busy and sometimes it’s hard to figure out a time to practice a foreign language.<br />
<br />
The same applies for many of our native Spanish speaking neighbors here in Costa Mesa. Because of this, Mika recently launched Language Learning Night.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Hey there,<br />
<br />
It’s a new year and we have big news. We started dreaming about what Wayfare would become over three years ago. It was our vision to create a workspace and support for organizations that would birth movements for the common good.<br />
<br />
As we were forming the organization, we decided on the name Wayfare because it captured the heart behind our vision. The word Wayfare has a double meaning. It means the act of journeying. It also means provisions for the journey. This word clearly encompassed the community we envisioned—a community of creators, doers, and adventurers aspiring to pursue the common good and support each other in the journey.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Lots of people are saying 2016 was one of the worst years, and so they are looking at 2017 with hope, excitement and lots of plans to make big changes. I don’t know if 2016 was my worst year, but it was for sure my busiest. During overwhelming times like these, my dad says, “Life can feel like trying to drink out of fire hose. It all just comes at once and you feel like you may drown.” I was drowning this year! This year I was tasked with restarting a church that had experienced a huge decline and I published my first book where I was the primary author. The project included art, video and writing. So it was a crazy year where every other day I thought I was going under. Let alone feeling like I had a personal life.</p>

        <p class="card-text">I’ve been pondering the concept of legacy a lot lately. Perhaps because I just had my second daughter-and I’m overly intentional about the words that come out of my mouth towards and about them. I want every day, every moment, to be wrapped around intention because, truth is, girls still need to hear that they can and should do the hard and holy things in the world.<br />
<br />
There’s another side to legacy that drives me. My mom. She is not my hero. No, the complete opposite. Her life was an example of everything I never want to be-selfish, addict, abusive, promiscuous…lost. My birth mom raised me to fear the world, fear her hand, fear her words. She made me believe my worth is in my sexuality and I’m only as good as the attention I received from guys. To go to college, to have a life long spouse, to do better for myself, well, this was selfish and wrong and I obviously thought I was better than everyone for doing so.</p>
