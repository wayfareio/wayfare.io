<h2>Launch Program</h2>
<p>Do you want to do something meaningful for the world AND earn a livable income? Are you past the idea stage, but you've taken your product as far as you can on your own? Are you looking to turn your hobby, side job, or minimum viable product (MVP) into a full-time gig? If you answered any of these questions with "Yes!", our Launch Program is for you.</p>
<p>We'll guide you as you bring clarity to your mission and vision, understand and articulate the personal "Why?" behind your product or service, focus and build a comprehensive business model, develop your communications plans, pitch to partners, raise funds, and learn how to optimize your leadership.</p>
<p>And in the span of 15 weeks, we'll deliver the practical, emotional, and spiritual support and guidance you need to create what we call a minimum viable organization (MVO).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Weekly dinners with startup founders to learn from their successes and mistakes</li>
