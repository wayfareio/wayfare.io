## Launch Program

Launch is an hyper-local 20-week intensive program based in Orange County, California. In this program, you will explore key startup principles and insights as you directly apply them to your product, program, or service amongst a cohort of other like-minded founders. Together you will receive the practical, emotional, and spiritual support you need to propel your product, program, or service into a comprehensive business model.

As you build your comprehensive business model, you will work on identifying and defining your mission and vision, understanding and articulating the personal “Why?” behind your product, program or service, developing your communications plans, pitching to partners, ensuring financial viability, and learning how to optimize your leadership.


**Launch includes:**

* **Two-day Intensive Kick-off**: Two full days of work sessions where we introduce you to key concepts and practical tools necessary to build a comprehensive business model. This gives you a chance to immerse yourself in what’s to come. This kickoff is our time to bond and get to know each other as a cohort!
* **Weekly dinners with startup founders** to learn from their successes and mistakes: Founders dinners are off-the-record, candid family-style dinners with entrepreneurs and founders. Each dinner will feature guest founders from a variety of backgrounds and experiences. They’ll share the good, bad, and ugly from their experiences in the startup world. The night will allow space for a Q&A with the speakers. And, since we have everyone sign nondisclosure agreements, our guest speakers can give you some of the hard truths they can’t share publicly.
* **Weekly Tuesday Worksessions**: Morning work sessions provide you with practical knowledge, concepts & tools to apply to your organization. These aren’t just talking heads or lectures, they’re sessions where you will put into practice what you are learning right away. Afternoon work sessions also provide space for the emotional and spiritual support as you process through the organizational and leadership challenges and opportunities you are facing.
* **Coaching/Consulting with a dedicated coach**: Coaches will support and guide you in your journey. These session are led by you, which means you get to make sure your most important decisions are being guided by what you need most.
* **Access to our advisor network**: Advising Office Hour sessions will be scheduled at various points throughout the program. Our advisor network consists of individuals and startup experts from diverse industries that have experience in many different aspects of starting an organization. Founders will be able to sign up for free 30 minute sessions with advisors to ask questions and brainstorm with them. Though not required, these are highly encouraged.
* **Demo Night, Pitch Night, and other business development events**: Presentations are a hallmark of the program. You and your fellow participants will be presenting to a room full of your family members, friends, and highly connected and influential individuals. These nights are important because they help you find the resources you need to build and grow your organization. Practicing your pitches will occur regularly in the afternoon work sessions.
* **Wayfare membership and workspace access**: As a member of Wayfare's startup incubator, you will have access to put what you're learning into action by working alongside a likeminded community at any of our productive, comfortable and beautiful designed workspaces.
