We have neighbors who are experiencing homelessness within our community everyday. This education piece covers the following:
1. Understanding homelessness (Future in Humanity)
2. Mental health in relation to homelessness (St. Jude)
3. Best practices (Fullerton PD Homeless Liaison Officers)
4. How you can help (Fullerton ACT)
5. Why we should love our neighbors well (Optional faith component at the end given by Fullerton ACT)
We hope that after this event you gain a little more understanding of the issue and gain compassion towards those currently without a home.
