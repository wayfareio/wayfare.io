Whether you have an abstract idea to make the world a better place, you've nailed that idea down and want the structure and community to begin taking meaningful action, or want to pilot a new product within your existing organization, we invite you to join Pilot Weekend. Pilot is an energizing three days, where you'll draft problem and solution statements, identify your purpose, learn how to test your assumptions and hypotheses, and understand who your future customers are. Our unique format delivers compelling insight from startup experts, personalized coaching AND guided application in a workshop setting. You'll leave with a roadmap for your idea to become a reality and a community of other dreamers and doers for the common good.
