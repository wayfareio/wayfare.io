Jenna has been teaching both modern calligraphy, floral watercolor workshops around the country for the past four years and is sure to provide each student with the best beginner level tools and techniques to learn what she does professionally. We're excited to offer these workshops in our new studio space, Mon Voir HQ, in sunny southern California, as well as other spaces and venues around the country and WORLD with our online classes!

This three hour course is a perfect fit for beginning watercolor artists or for those looking to find a different approach to their skill! This class will start off with going through quality materials and which brushes and supplies Jenna prefers to use. She'll then cover tips and techniques for brush strokes, creating basic shapes, color theory and blending. Once you've gone through this material, you will incorporate how you've structured basic shapes into florals! Jenna will go over which brushes to use in order to form leaves, berries, peonies and more! With layering, shading, wet-in-wet painting, and other techniques Jenna prefers to use.

Each student will receive a take home kit of Jenna's preferred supplies. This kit will include a palette with 7 trays of paint, two brushes, paper and Jenna's Intro to Floral Watercolor Booklet.

All materials are provided, plus refreshments! 

Non-refundable. 

Class will be held at:
