Have you ever wanted to try your hand in watercolor, never got around to buying the supplies, and don't necessarily want to commit to a class?

Well, you're in luck, because we're going to make this really easy on you. We're hosting a Wayfare Watercolor gathering, where you can bring your friends, give watercolor a try, and have some wine and dessert while we play your favorite music. No formal instruction will be provided, but we'll kick off the night with a very basic demonstration on how to use the provided supplies. Come try your hand or practice your growing skills at this fun and relaxing evening of painting!
