The light streaming into the beautiful shared space was the first thing I noticed. The natural light from the atrium created this warm glow, but the most impressive light came from the passionate people who worked at Wayfare and I only noticed it more and more as the internship went on. 

What even is an internship? A part time job before an actual job? An internship is not about showing off your strengths, it’s about learning and cultivating them.

One of the very first things the interns did together was take a strengths finder test and discuss our results as a group. Totally clueless going into the test, I was so surprised by the results. Not only did I learn the nuances of my strengths, I learned how diverse the other interns and staff were. The beauty of this exercise was that no two people were the same and together we could complement each other to accomplish amazing goals. 

The three of us could not be any more different. Alandra was a recent college grad with a photography degree, nervous about how far her new art degree could take her. Desiree worked a full time job,and I was still in college, intimidated about being the youngest one. 

Over the course of this internship we got to see so many amazing things fulfilled. Interns usually get shafted and degraded into solely getting coffee or filing paperwork. But at Wayfare, we were treated like part of the Wayfare family. Work seriously becomes play when you’re surrounded by rad people and a cute little coffee shop that keeps you highly caffeinated. It’s so refreshing and inspiring to see a community like this dive full force into what they believe in all the while keeping their core values and the common good at the center.

Not only were we encouraged to build on our existing strengths, we were all motivated to discover strengths we never knew we had. Alandra Iearned that she was capable of so much more in just three mere months, and that her passion for photography could be implemented into multiple avenues of work. She explored creative direction, social media marketing strategy, visual branding, and story telling with a team that was generous, encouraging, and kind.
Deziree  was able to utilize her creative side to help with graphics and visuals with various projects and give input in upcoming campaigns. 

Even though I was the youngest intern, my voice was still heard. Heard most clearly in the captions, content planning, and blog posts that I took ownership of. Everyday was an adventure, tailoring stories at Wayfare, exploring the lives of others, and trying to capture that light that I was so enthralled by the first day. 

The light comes streaming in from everyones’ smiles, the passion that drives their dreams, the way they interact with one another and I know we’ve all been so blessed to experience and soak in this light for this short internship. 

Wayfare is about community and you are all apart of that. When you embrace it and run with it, we all become stronger, wiser and more effective. We have learned so much here about leadership and quality work from these humble souls. We are leaving better people and that has been the biggest take away. You can’t buy that or fake it, you have to actually experience the light that flows from here and live it.
