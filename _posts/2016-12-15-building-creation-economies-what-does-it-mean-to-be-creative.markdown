In this series entitled "Building Creation Economies" we've talked about [The Confounding Merger of Work and Leisure](/stories/2016/12/02/the-confounding-merger-of-work-and-leisure/) and [What is Work?](/stories/2016/12/09/building-creation-economies-what-is-work/). Now, let’s look at what it means to be a creator. I propose three components:
1. Creators are rooted in their identity
2. They have deep self awareness
3. They know their unique strengths, skills, and abilities

Identity is never found in individualism, isolation, and self-centeredness. It is always found in relationship.

The question we need to constantly ask is this: What is my best contribution to the world? If you don’t know the answer to that question, you’re not alone. To redeem work, we must ask it.

**Creators display artistry**

Artistry is creating beauty, and not just visually, but in all realms. You can be an artist in designing handbags or in designing organizations or in the way you clean a room. Artistry is not limited to the “creative class.” Don’t let “creatives” exclude your unique identity from this work. And creatives, you can help others recognize the ways in which they are artists in the seemingly mundane endeavors of everyday life. The question we need to constantly ask is this: God, what beauty are you creating today, and how are you inviting me to be an artist?

**Creators make meaning**

I think we all get this. We all want a sense of purpose in our lives, but for me, making meaning is for others. Our meaning is rooted in our identity, but this is different. This is about seeing the best in others and helping them find their meaning.
This is an other-orientation that fights against the self-centeredness we see at the root of all other sin. 

We are commanded to love God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength, and love our neighbors as ourselves. The love for ourselves is embracing our identity, loving others is to make meaning for them and help them live into their identity and artistry. 
The question we need to constantly ask is this: How am I, right here, right now, making meaning for others?

I believe we’re in one of the most profound cultural shifts in the history of the world. We’ve moved from hunter/gatherers to an agrarian economy to the industrial revolution to the information age. And we’re on the cusp of what some are calling the innovation economy, but I don’t think that word does it justice, because it doesn’t capture the fullness of life that God intends for us and his original model for work in the garden. I believe we are in the creation economy. The creation economy is a subversive economy that’s fighting against toil and entropy that are too normal in our world. It is countercultural. It demands whole life pursuit of our identity, artistry, and meaning.

And this is my invitation to you today...to enter into a conversation with us at Wayfare about what it means to be people of the creation economy: 

People of the creation economy refuse to engage around anything other than creation or re-creation. They refuse to contribute to the political diatribes or the useless arguments about who won debates. They refuse to scroll mindlessly through Facebook or Instagram feeds. They refuse to toil through the next Netflix series that they just have to watch. Instead, they focus on restoring what is broken and creating beauty. 

People of the creation economy realize that the problem of work is actually a problem of toil. The problem isn’t that we work too much. On the contrary, it’s that we toil too much on distractions and work too little on creation. The problem is that we are consumed by transacting work rather than transforming work as an act of creation or re-creation. 

Acts of creation or re-creation could be as complex as building a multinational NGO to fight extreme poverty around the world or as simple as picking up your kids’ toys at the end of the day--or sometimes over and over, all day --as an act of re-creation because it is part of the fight against the entropy introduced with the fall.

The questions we need to ask ourselves are these: **What is my best contribution to the world? What beauty am I being called to create? And what meaning can I make as an act of love for others?**

This creation work, which is rooted in identity, displaying artistry, and making meaning for others is the future past of work. It was always the intention. And it can be true of us again. Let’s redeem work. Let’s be people of the creation economy, and let’s create the world’s best future together.
