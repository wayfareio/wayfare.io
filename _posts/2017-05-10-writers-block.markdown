The majority of my job is writing. I like to write and I like to read. So you'd think I'd be all about managing a blog, getting guest submissions, and writing posts. But lately I've let this blog to the side as I've been focusing on other writing projects for the new name reveal and for our startup programs. The truth is there is I'm feeling a really big case of writer's block lately. I have a whole lot of thoughts in my head and ideas of what to write, but when I go to put pen to paper (or fingers to the keyboard) I feel stuck. <!-- more -->

I was having an impromptu lunch with one of our members recently and we were catching up on life. Joanna Waterfall and she's the founder of Yellow Co., a company she started to bring together and equip creative entrepreneurial women to use their gifts and talents to be agents of good in the world through the Yellow Conference and the Yellow Collective, as well as amazing blog content in the Yellow Room. 

She asked how I was doing I told her I was having a hard time writing all of the things that I wanted to. She gave me a solid piece of very simple advice (she's really good at that) and then my wheels got turning a little bit. So I'm passing along three very simple things that can be done today to help get past creative blocks. 

1. Do something, even if it is horrible. 
There is a pretty well known idea in the writing world called a Bad First Draft (others have more colorful language for said first draft, but I'm keeping it G rated today). We often put so much pressure on ourselves to write something amazing right out of the gate. Joanna reminded me that writing something, even if it is terrible, is an essential element to forward movement on a goal. You'll obviously need to go back and edit it, or perhaps change it almost entirely. But getting it out there is important. This concept can obviously apply to more than writing. I recommend it for any form of work frustration. Getting something out there keeps things moving. Be okay with something. Then go back later and pick it apart. 

2. Step Away
Once you've gotten it out there, step away. Go do something else. Grab coffee, go for a walk, hit the gym. Whatever it is, do something that clears your mind and takes you away from what you wrote so you can go back and look at it with fresh eyes. 

3. Talk to someone
After taking to Joanna and my husband about my frustrations they not only had some good and simple advice, but they were encouraging to me. Never underestimate the value of others speaking into your experience, both practically and emotionally. Talking it out helped me articulate exactly what I was experiencing and also allows others to give me a perspective outside my own. 

So there you have it. A quick post about what to do when you just don't think you can do it. Obviously writer's block isn't even close to among the most pressing problems in the world. But I think these principles can apply to so many more situations. When we work to bring goodness to the world, we'll naturally face resistance in many forms. So keep doing something, take time to step away, talk to others, and then come back to it.
