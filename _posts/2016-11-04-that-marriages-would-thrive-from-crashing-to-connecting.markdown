What do you think of when the word marriage comes up? Long flowing white dress? Small house in the suburbs? Two individuals who are devoted to spending the rest of their lives together? <!-- more-->

When Casey and Meygan met each other in college, it was love at first sight. Young and in love, they decided to get married just two years later. The young couple went into their new stage of life full of wonder and love. 

While marriage is a beautiful union, it is not at all what the movies depict it to be. Between both sets of parents, there were 12 marriages. They knew firsthand the troubles, the pain, and the brokenness of marriage. Refusing to let those failed marriages affect their future, Casey and Meygan dove into their marriage headfirst to prove to themselves that marriage can work. 

That idealized view came crashing down soon enough as their lives became plagued with arguments after arguments. Wasn’t marriage the answer to happiness? Why was it suddenly so difficult to maintain happiness after they said “I do”? They vowed that divorce was not an option, but things seemed so bleak and the first three years of the marriage progressively became worse and worse. They were missing connection.  

But this is not where their story ends. Casey and Meygan knew it was time for a change. But what would help rekindle their marriage? They surrounded themselves with mentors that guided them through this difficult season. They sought to improve and work on themselves before finding fault in the other. They read any book they could get their hands on and attended a marriage boot camp! In many ways, they started dating each other again, discovering what made the other person tick, learning how to communicate better, taking up hobbies together, to back when they were two wide eyed college lovers. They were committed to connecting again. 

Through commitment and connecting, they learned that great marriages don’t just happen by accident. It takes a lot of work, intentionality 365 days a year; thus Marriage365 was born! Casey and Meygan are continually striving to help keep marriages thriving to help out similarly struggling couples, whether that’s through their monthly podcast, online courses, or even being coaches and mentors. They want to see marriages last a lifetime and be a part of the solution. Too often marriage counseling hovers on two extremes; focusing on only family and not the underlying problems or too individualistic, often resulting in divorce. [Marriage365](http://marriage365.org) uniquely places itself in the middle, getting down to the raw issues while focusing and family and love. 

Their advice for struggling couples? “Many married couples do not want to spend time or money on their marriage until it's too late. They don't see the value of regular maintenance with their relationship. The biggest advice we would give is that money, careers, your home, your car all can come and go but your relationships with others is where you'll find true happiness and contentment. It's truly how you should measure your success in life.”
