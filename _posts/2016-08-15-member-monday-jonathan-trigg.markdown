excerpt: I am currently developing the business model for The Integrated which essentially
  supports emerging adults, age 18-26, transition into adulthood. I am writing the
  curriculum and developing the website as well as doing everything, except social
  media (because I have an awesome intern team and intern director!). The Integrated
  started about 2 years ago when I decided I wanted to mentor a few college students
  because it is such a vital and crucial developmental time for them. Gandolf, aka
  Jeff Tanner (co-founder of Wayfare), planted the seed that my ideas could turn into
  a non-profit... so here I am today.

**If you could go anywhere in the world you haven't been, where would you go and why?**

I am currently developing the business model for The Integrated which essentially supports emerging adults, age 18-26, transition into adulthood. I am writing the curriculum and developing the website as well as doing everything, except social media (because I have an awesome intern team and intern director!). The Integrated started about 2 years ago when I decided I wanted to mentor a few college students because it is such a vital and crucial developmental time for them. Gandolf, aka Jeff Tanner (co-founder of Wayfare), planted the seed that my ideas could turn into a non-profit... so here I am today.

Because the Integrated is a startup and I needed some form of income, I also work at Sidecar Doughnuts & Coffee as a Manager.

**How do you stay inspired and productive?**

Reading, podcasts, and good conversations.

**What's your favorite part of your work?**

The free doughnuts and coffee. Duh.

But seriously, I love sharing the mission and vision and seeing others get excited about it and want to be involved some how. It's super fun. The other aspect is how much I continue to grow and be stretched as I try to figure this thing out. I have grown so much in so many areas of life. If you'd like to learn more about those areas of growth, check out my [website](www.theintegrated.life)!

**What are some of the biggest challenges of your work and what advice would you give to someone experiencing similar challenges?**

The unknown and the fear of making mistakes. Something I keep running into is that I miss 100% of the shots I don't take. Yep, that's from Wayne Gretzky, but it so true. Keep taking risks and every failure means knowledge and growth for pushing your business forward or just growing personally in all aspects.

**Why did you decide to work out of Wayfare?**

Gandalf (Jeff Tanner) told me to. Whatever Gandolf says, you do.

I started because I was and still am so new the the business and startup world and Wayfare is such a great support for me spiritually, practically, and emotionally as I press on into the wilderness of starting a business. There is also such a rad network of other entrepreneurs doing amazing things to advance the common good in different ways that makes working here so much fun to connect with, partner with, and collaborate with other like-minded folk.

**What are some ways (if any) we can support you and get involved with your work?**

It's difficult to say at the moment as the Wayfare community has and still supports me in every way I can imagine right now!

One thing we are doing right now with the Integrated is collecting stories for our blog from adults that have experience & wisdom to share with young 20-somethings emerging into adulthood. We'd love to have you share the things you wish you would have heard when you were younger and the wisdom you've gleaned along the way. If you would like to share your story with us, please email me at **jonathan@theintegrated.life**.
