Four new startups have been accepted into Wayfare Labs’ second batch (Batch 2). We’re excited to see them launch their movements and begin forming their institutions. Let’s take a look at these missional organizations and their intrepid founders.

##The Yellow Conference
Founder: Joanna Waterfall and Sally Kim

The purpose of the Yellow Conference is to gather, connect, inspire, and equip creative women who want to make a difference in the world. They believe that by empowering and equipping women, they are changing the world by teaching them how to change the world. The problem (as they see it) is that women have a deep desire to use their talent to create change, but they don’t have the resources, the connections, or the knowledge they need to pursue their purpose.


##The Meat and Vegetables Trading Company
Founder: Jennifer Saunders

Jennifer wants to create a one-for-one model food truck where time would be sustainably split between selling food to paying customers and using the profits from those sales to cover the costs of giving that same product to homeless and at risk communities. Eventually, she wants to develop relationships with local homeless resource centers in order to direct the homeless she serves toward those resources.


##Mondo Bongo
Founders: Moses Nolf and Nick Delja

Our purpose is to equip and empower those living below the poverty line in Costa Mesa with basic job skills, computer skills, and programming/coding skills with the intention of placing them in a new job or career that pays a fair wage. Our ultimate goal is to break generational cycles of poverty.


##The Reclamation Society
Founders: Jay Sherer and Nathan Scheck

The Reclamation Society exists to reclaim and recycle modern-day storytelling by infusing Truth into books, comics, graphic novels, and film. They believe that storytelling has a direct impact on culture, yet most media is either full of half-truths, outright lies, or directed solely at a Christian audience. They believe that storytelling must reach those far from God, speak to them in their language, and yet still reflect the Truth of Jesus Christ.


##Writer's Room Productions
Founder: Amber Q. Robins

Writer's Room Productions is all about inspiring students through creative writing. They help students become leaders, encourage them to build strong coping skills, and help children think outside the box. They exist to ignite and inspire the next generation through a variety of assembly and workshop programs (even expanding their program to children who are living in long-term hospital care or home situations). Writer's Room Productions strives to promote healing and confidence building experience in the communities where they operate.
