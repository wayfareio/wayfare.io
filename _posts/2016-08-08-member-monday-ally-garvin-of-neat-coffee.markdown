excerpt: Day to day, you can mostly find me slinging lattes, running errands, creating
  new syrup flavors and catching up with my regulars but I am slowly making more time
  for myself to work on my business instead of at my business. If I had known how
  much hard work being a business owner would take, I probably would have never taken
  the leap but I can't imagine doing anything else. After falling in love with coffee
  on a farm in Uganda and working at 3 local coffee shops here in Costa Mesa, I decided
  to go for it on my own. I am currently the owner, manager, accountant, social media
  coordinator, and one of two baristas for Neat Coffee but I am working hard toward
  eventually having a full team, a better work/life balance and a larger shop that
  serves excellent coffee and provides a healthy space for the community.

**Who are you?**

Ally Garvin

**What's the name of your company?**

[Neat Coffee](http://neat.coffee)

**The best movie of all time is clearly....**

E.T.!

**What's your favorite local restaurant?**

Boathouse Collective

**How would you spend your ideal day off?**

I would spend my whole day off outside, from sunrise to sunset. Throw in a few good meals, a hike, the ocean, something new and some friends and it's perfect.

**If you could go anywhere in the world you haven't been, where would you go and why?**

I would go to Japan to check out the local coffee culture, eat amazing food and explore the smaller towns and countryside with David.

**What do you do for work? Tell us a little bit about how you got to where you are today.**

**How do you stay inspired? Productive?**

I stay inspired by hearing other people's stories and visiting other coffee shops. On my admin days, I enjoy placing orders and working out my profit margins from the comfort of Wayfare's lounge chairs and couches.

**What's your favorite part of your work?**

The people I get to see everyday, working with other local businesses and dreaming about the future of Neat Coffee.

**What are some of the biggest challenges of your work and what advice would you give to someone experiencing similar challenges?**

Besides the nitty gritty of working out profit margins, and knowing who and when to hire, it's hard to stay focused and to know what to say yes or no to as a new business owner. Create a vision/philosophy for your business based on your morals, values and goals and then let that guide your decisions. I would also suggest meeting on a regular basis with another business owner or someone smarter than you. Ask for help. Write down all of your ideas. Make tangible to-do lists and then create check points for yourself. It's important to look back at even a month ago to see what you've accomplished and then decide what you want/need to do next.

**Why did you decide to work out of Wayfare?**

Originally Keri Fox gave me the idea! I wanted a space where I could start out small, keep a low overhead and gain momentum while looking for a larger location. Wayfare has been the absolute ideal spot to start up shop and I don't think I'll ever leave. Neat and Wayfare are both based around a model of community and it turns out that we're pretty complimentary to each other :)

**What are some ways (if any) we can support you and get involved with your work?**

The Wayfare community has already done so much for Neat. Thanks for being so encouraging and supportive!

Visit Neat [online](http://neat.coffee) & on [social media](http://instagram.com/neat.coffee), and stop by to enjoy a tasty honey cinnamon or lavender latte during Neat's open hours:
