**The best movie of all time is clearly....**

The Three Amigos

**What's your favorite local restaurant?**

Taco Surf... it's my sons favorite place to eat.

**How would you spend your ideal day off?**

Wake up and make breakfast for my wife and son than hit the beach for some surfing. Comeback home to play with my kid and then finish it off with a bbq with friends. And I currently try and do this at least once a month

**If you could go anywhere in the world you haven't been, where would you go and why?**

Indonesia is at the top of my bucket list. It has everything I want to experience - waves, food, adventure and culture. 

**What do you do for work? Tell us a little bit about how you got to where you are today.**

Where I began and where I am is a long and adventurous dotted line but it all began because of my love for surfing. My love for surfing has been the driving force behind my career. I started out owning a surf shop after graduating from college which then led to me developing marketing skills I never knew I had. 

My surf shop days really guided me to many great opportunities that eventually led me to starting my own marketing agency. We launched in 1998 and our first client was Red Bull. We helped create their marketing strategy here in the U.S.. 

It was also while working at the agency that I discovered philanthropy. I was asked to join the Board of Directors for Surfrider Foundation and this experience taught me the importance of sharing my knowledge and network to help them achieve their goals. I would say that this was the single most important opportunity that helped me to grow in my personal and professional career.

Since then I've served on more than a dozen non-profit and corporate boards and it looks like its becoming part of my career track.

In between serving others, I also run HDX, a sports drink mix that I founded in 2011. This consumes the majority of my time.

**How do you stay inspired? Productive?**

I'm inspired by other entrepreneurs and non-profits. I love hearing stories of why people are starting their own business. 

I also look at non-profits for inspiration, these are organizations that are trying to solve tough problems and you can learn a lot from the problems they're addressing and the types of solutions they're looking for. 

I also listen to a lot of Ted Talks, you can learn so much from the inspirational messages found in every kind of Ted Talk. 

**What's your favorite part of your work?**

For HDX, I really enjoy talking to my customers. When people call or email us and tell us how much they love our product, how its made a different in their life or even suggestions for what we could do better, that's the best part of running my business. 

Our customers are the most important part of our business and we have to be open to their voices and you can tell that they want to see us succeed so that's why they're sharing their thoughts with us.

**What are some of the biggest challenges of your work and what advice would you give to someone experiencing similar challenges?**

The biggest challenge for me at this stage in my life is time management. It's the one thing that we can use more of but with limited availability we have to use it sparingly and make sure that we make the best use of our day.

I prioritize my time in the following: 
1. Family 
2. Work
3. Me

Everything I do has to fit into one of the above time slots. 

My suggestions to others who are having similar challenges is to determine what your full day is going to look like. Is it 9 to 5 or sunrise to sunset? My schedule is 5:00AM to 11:00PM - that's a pretty full day but you'd be surprised how much you can get done if you prioritize every hour and cut out the nonsense. I don't feel stressed or overworked and wake up everyday energized and ready to tackle anything that comes my way. 

**Why did you decide to work out of FLDWRK?**

I had looked at other shared workspaces but after a visit and meeting the some of the people working here it felt like home. It's a very creative environment and sitting alongside other entrepreneurs makes FLDWRK a great place to work and meet some great people!
