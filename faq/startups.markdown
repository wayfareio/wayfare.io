## Startup Programs FAQ

##### Who are startup programs for?

Whether you’re someone that has an idea, leading an organization of 20 or more people, or somewhere in between, Wayfare’s startup programs help to bring clarity and meaning to the work that you are doing through practical, spiritual, and emotional support amongst a community of likeminded people. Each program is designed for a specific stage of development for a founder or startup. See our <a href="/startups">startups page</a> for more information.

Prices vary. See our [startup program pages](/startups) for specific details.

##### What kind of speakers will I hear from?

Our curated network of advisors come from diverse industries, areas of expertise, backgrounds, and perspectives; yet they all share the same heart for helping businesses thrive & advancing the common good. The content they share is at the cross section of inspiration and insightful, so you are encouraged and equipped to tackle the unique startup journey you are on.

##### What kind of topics do you cover?

Our programs address content from various key areas of development that we’ve identified as essential to the startup journey.

##### Can I pitch at Pitch Night without being in a startup program?
