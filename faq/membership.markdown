## Membership FAQ

##### How do I become a member?

Become a Wayfare member by joining one of our workspaces or startup programs. Whether you need a place to work a few days a week, a program to help you pilot your new idea, support to grow your organization into sustainability, or office for you and your team---we’ve got you covered. Start by [finding a workspace](/locations) or checking out our [startup programs](/startups).

##### Is Wayfare membership month to month?#####

_Yep!_ Our memberships are all month-to-month to allow flexibility and growth based on your unique [coworking](/locations) or [startup](/startups) needs.

##### Do I need to be a member to work at a Wayfare workspace?

No, you do not need to be a member to work out of Wayfare, but membership allows more flexibility at more affordable rates to work at any of our spaces*.

\*Drop-in rates vary by location. To view yours, visit your [location's](/locations) rates page.

##### What kind of events do you host for members?

In addition to monthly [Forum](/membership/learn-from-others) events, we throw occasional member events like holiday parties, community dinners, and more! We also offer generous discounts to any workshops or conferences that are hosted at Wayfare locations.
