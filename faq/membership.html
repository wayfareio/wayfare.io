    <h5>Is Wayfare membership month to month?</h5>
    <p>Yep! Our membership and coworking packages are all month-to-month. No commitments are necessary, and no cancellation notice is necessary. Read more on our <a href="https://guide.books.wayfare.io/" >guidebook</a>.</p>

    <h5>I just need workspace and/or meeting rooms. Do I need to be a member to work at a Wayfare workspace?</h5>
    <p>No, you do not need to be a member to work at Wayfare, but membership allows more flexibility at more affordable rates to work at any of our spaces.</p>
    <p>Members receive access to the lowest pay-as-you-go coworking rates, discounts on meeting rooms, and $15 of monthly credit to use on coworking or meeting rooms.</p>
    <p>Rates vary by location. To view yours, visit your location's rates page.</p>

    <h5>I don't need workspace. What's in it for me?</h5>
    <p>If you live in Southern California, you'll have access to come to our frequent member events (like monthly Forum and taco parties) and get involved with the community. You'll also be able to work flexibly at any Wayfare location.</p>
    <p>If you don't live in Southern California, stay tuned. We've got something exciting coming your way soon!</p>

    <h5>What kind of events do you host for members?</h5>
    <p>In addition to monthly Forum events, we throw occasional member events like holiday parties, community dinners, and more! We also offer generous discounts to any workshops or conferences that are hosted at Wayfare locations.</p>

    <h5>Can I give this membership to someone as a gift?</h5>
    <p class="p-b-1">That's super cool of you, and we think you just scored some major brownie points with Uncle Joe. Please contact us to purchase.</p>
