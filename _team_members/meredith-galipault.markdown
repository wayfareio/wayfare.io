**On the weekend you can catch Meredith:** doing a pop-up for her jewelry business, Wildflower Roots, adventuring around the OC, or re-watching episodes of Friends/Seinfeld/The Office.

**Be sure to ask Meredith about:** how she can paint your face like a tiger, the time she thought she was going to die in Cambodia or about riding the trains everyday while living in India.
