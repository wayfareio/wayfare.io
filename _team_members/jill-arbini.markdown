**On the weekend you can catch Jill:** exploring Southern California with her husband and three kids, at the beach, or perusing flea markets and yard sales. Oh and drinking coffee. Always coffee.

**Be sure to ask Jill about:** the time she was a suspect in an armed robbery (a case of mistaken identity), her plans to live in an Airstream trailer one day, or her obsession with the Wisconsin Badgers.
