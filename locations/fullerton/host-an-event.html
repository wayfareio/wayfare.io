      <p>For every potential event, we offer one half hour of complimentary services to answer any questions and do walk-throughs of the space. Once your event is booked we offer 1 hour of additional complimentary services prior to the event to answer any space related questions, develop a space layout plan to best suit your needs, and do a final walkthrough of the space prior to your event. We have found that this is plenty of time to cover the basic questions you may have in regards to the space and how your event will run. As part of this complimentary service, we are happy to include information about what has worked well for past events.</p>
      <p>Should you desire more time in planning your event or for us to provide additional services in the form of consultations on run-of-program, decorations, procurement of rentals, staffing, or day of coordination, we are happy to provide those services for an additional fee depending on your specific needs.</p>
      <p>Should your event require more than we are able to offer, we have a large network of trusted event planners, designers &amp; coordinators that we are happy to provide referrals to upon request.</p>
