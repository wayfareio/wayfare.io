<h2>Opening Soon!</h2>
<!-- p>Wayfare Fullerton is located in the heart of downtown in the historic Chapman buildling. It was the tallest building in Orange County when it was built in 1923, inspired by a combination of Chicago Skyscraper and New York architecture. The building was a prime example of the prosperous, unbounded optimism of its time and was named after the first mayor of Fullerton and well-known early century businessman, Charles C. Chapman. In conjunction with the construction of a public parking structure at its rear, the Chapman Building was completely restored in the 1980's as a bank.</p -->
<!-- p>Wayfare Fullerton is located in the ground floor of this historic building, boasting in a total of 7,000 sq. ft. comprised of a 4,000 sq. ft. coworking area downstairs and 3,000 sq. ft. of upstairs mezzanine space comprised primarily of offices and dedicated desks.</p -->
