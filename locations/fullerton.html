<h2>About this Space</h2>
<p>Located in the heart of downtown, Wayfare's Fullerton space is located on the ground floor of the historic Chapman Bank Building - a five story structure built in 1923 in the stylistic vein of the Chicago School of architecture. This space features private offices on the upstairs mezzanine, and coworking, lounges, meeting rooms, and a coffee bar on the ground level. Buzzing with the life of downtown, Wayfare Fullerton is walking distance from endless amounts of food and retail. Less than an hour from LAX, this location is the ideal space for client meetings, conferences, fundraisers, and much more.</p>
<p>Already an architectural find in the area, the build-out and furnishing of the space will focus on combining existing architectural elements (mouldings, railings, tile work, etc) with a fresh California-cool vibe (high contrast neutral color palette, light, warm wood tones). Lighting, soft seating and accent pieces hint at the opulence of the roaring 20s while feeling perfectly now and effortless. Featured local artwork and a balcony lined with indoor plants and trees overlooking the main space create energy and inspiration, and work to ground the grandness of the space allowing its allure to feel accessible.</p>
